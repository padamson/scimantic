# SemFlow Paper: Dogfooding Example

This directory demonstrates using SemFlow to document SemFlow itself as a semantic publication.

## What's in This Directory

- **project.ttl**: The complete knowledge graph capturing the research process
  - Evidence from literature (starting with Kuhn et al. 2016 on nanopublications)
  - Hypotheses derived from evidence
  - Design decisions and their rationale
  - Implementation provenance
  - Analysis of case studies

- **nanopubs/**: Published nanopublications (generated by semflow-core)
  - Individual assertions with provenance
  - Trusty URIs for immutable references
  - Signed and timestamped

## The Research Process

### Starting Point: Nanopublications Paper
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3233/DS-170010

**Key insight**: "The smallest unit of publishable information is a nanopublication—an assertion with its provenance and publication info."

### The Research Question
**Can a semantic-first framework improve reproducibility and enable AI-assisted research?**

### Workflow
1. **Literature review** → Evidence entities in project.ttl
2. **Hypothesis formation** → Hypothesis derived from evidence
3. **Design** → Architecture decisions linked to hypothesis
4. **Implementation** → The semflow codebase itself
5. **Analysis** → Case study (semflow-paper)
6. **Publication** → Nanopublications in nanopubs/

## How to Generate This

```bash
# From semflow root, use the VS Code extension or CLI to:
# 1. Search literature and add evidence
# 2. Mint hypotheses from evidence
# 3. Document design decisions
# 4. Link implementation commits to design
# 5. Publish nanopublications

# The project.ttl and nanopubs/ will be generated automatically
```

## Why This Example Matters

- **Dogfooding**: Using semflow to document semflow validates the approach
- **Meta-research**: Demonstrates semantic publishing for software frameworks
- **Complete provenance**: Every claim traces back to evidence
- **Machine-readable**: SPARQL queries answer research questions
- **AI-friendly**: MCP agents can understand and extend the work
